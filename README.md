#Hello World

my name is delphine. delphine nyaboke. for work, i am a student at jomo kenyatta university of agriculture and technology, trying to understand the world of electrical and electronic engineering by pursuing a bachelors degree. ha-ha. when i ain't chasing that degree, you find me in  high schools mentoring and volunteering in the their program(s).

and oh! food occupies a substantial space in my head.
